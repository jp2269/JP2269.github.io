I am currently a student at Cornell Tech, pursuing my MBA. 

I've been a New Yorker most of my life, growing up here since I was 7, attending Edgemont highschool, going to Binghamton University, and working at IBM Poughkeepsie for the last 4 years. 

At Binghamton University, I completed a dual degree in both Finance and Computer Engineering, obtaining degrees from both the school of management and the Watson school of engineering in 4 years. I've completed over 225 credit as the degree requirements did not overlap much and took part in both the PwC scholars / Binghamton university wide Scholars program. My highlight at my time in school was to speak at the commencement ceremony with my grandparents in attendance whom flew in from South Korea.

At IBM, my main role as a software engineer was to help solve client's most critical problems. I worked on a variety of issues that ranged from simple errors to high severity issues that included major outages. My most interesting experiences working with clients included presenting in front of many C-level executives and high level government officials. Outside of my main role, I took part in creating new projects and tools to help the organization. My most notable project was to modernize our legacy infrastructure in how engineers debug client problems. The status quo was to use a black 80x24 terminal to a modern webpage. Utilizing REST-APIs, javascript, and other modern tools, the team and I created a new product that allowed engineers to debug on a webpage. The product won multiple competitions internally, and recently launched as a beta product for large banking customers as partners. I will go in depth about my projects in a post!

Outside of my job, my hobbies include traveling, hiking, cooking, and playing with my dog Ollie!
