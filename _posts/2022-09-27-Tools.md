## Why I work on tools

Efficiency is paramount as an engineer on a call with customers who are in desparate need to solve their issue. In my role as a z/OS software developer, I worked with many clients that dealt with severe outages that led to SLA misses and had potential to be on the news. when on a call with the executives and business representatives from both IBM and the client, they are usually concerned with the following: how fast can we get back up, will this happen again, and what can we do to avoid it while it is fixed. 

In order to answer these questions and concerns quickly, I worked on a variety of scripts. I personally created 100s of scripts to find important data easily, display output intuitively, and automate manual processes that used to take hours into a few minutes. For example, I created a REXX exec that automated the formatting of control blocks within the Supervisor component.
