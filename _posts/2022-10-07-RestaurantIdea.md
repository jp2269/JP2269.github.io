# Have you ever had to make plans with more than 2 people? 

As many of you have experienced, picking a restaurant with more than 1 other person is usually a challenge. There are many opinions, dietary restrictions, location preferences, etc. The worst is when half the group cares about certain things but won't participate in deciding a place other than to reject options. 

## Lets solve this pain point!

My idea is to create a Tinder-like application that people in the group can swipe on anonymously to get a concensus on a restaurant. The list can be curated by using Yelp's API and have user put contributions.
