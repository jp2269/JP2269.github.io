## Abstract:

This blog post discusses an app that allows users to anonymously swipe on restaurants to get a consensus on where to eat. The app uses Yelp's API to curate a list of restaurants and allows users to add their own contributions.

## Introduction:

Have you ever been in a group of people trying to decide where to eat? It can be a tough decision, especially if everyone has different preferences. But what if there was an app that could help you make a decision?

The app I'm proposing is a Tinder-like application that people in the group can swipe on anonymously to get a consensus on a restaurant. The list of restaurants can be curated by using Yelp's API and users can add their own contributions.

## How It Works:

The app would work by allowing users to create a profile and then join a group. Once they're in a group, they can start swiping on restaurants. If they swipe left on a restaurant, they're not interested in it. If they swipe right on a restaurant, they're interested in it.

The app would then track how many people swipe right on each restaurant. The restaurant with the most swipe rights would be the consensus choice for the group.

## Benefits:

There are a number of benefits to using this app. First, it would save you time. Instead of spending hours trying to decide where to eat, you could just use the app to get a consensus quickly.

Second, it would be more democratic. Everyone in the group would have an equal say in where to eat.

Third, it would be more fun. The app would make the decision-making process more of a game.

## Conclusion:

I think this app would be a great way to make restaurant decisions. It's fast, democratic, and fun. If you're ever in a group trying to decide where to eat, I recommend giving it a try.
