## Abstract:

This blog post discusses a blockchain app idea that allows players to compete to solve a private key using Wordle-like puzzles. The first player to solve the private key wins the funds in the smart contract.

## Introduction:

Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize many industries, including gaming. One way that blockchain can be used in gaming is to create provably fair games. This means that players can be sure that the game is not rigged and that the results are fair.

One way to create a provably fair game is to use a smart contract. Smart contracts are pieces of code that run on the blockchain. They can be used to automate tasks and to create games that are provably fair.

## Proposed App:

The proposed app would use a smart contract to hold the funds. The smart contract would only release the funds to the first player to solve the private key. The private key would be a 12-word phrase that is generated randomly. The players would then compete to solve the private key by playing a series of Wordle-like puzzles. The first player to solve the private key would win the funds in the smart contract.

## Benefits of the App:

The proposed app has a number of benefits, including:

- It is provably fair.
- It is transparent.
- It is secure.
- It is fun and engaging.

## How to Play:

To play the game, players would first need to create an account on the app. Once they have created an account, they would need to deposit funds into the smart contract. The funds would then be locked until a player solves the private key.

Once the funds are locked, players can start playing the game. The game would work by players competing to solve the private key by playing a series of Wordle-like puzzles. The first player to solve the private key would win the funds in the smart contract.

## Conclusion:

The proposed app is a fun and engaging way to use blockchain technology. It is also a provably fair and secure way to play games.
